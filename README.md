    <p>Nicole is a self taught Urban Farmer in Los Angeles,CA.
      After learning about the explotation of the Earth and her children,
        she has embraced and experienced the health, mental and 
        spiritual benefits of working closely with the natural world,
        she now dedicates her life to remediating urban soils and ecosystems via growing food.
        She's also testing out her skills with animal husbandry.  
        She wishes to bring this wisdom into the urban cities and around the world for the benefit of all.
        She is also learning how to code with HTML and CSS and is hoping to merge her gifts with this new skill.
